# Run and deploy your AI Studio app

This contains everything you need to run your app locally.

View your app in AI Studio: https://ai.studio/apps/drive/166ZpXr9x8DJELCWw9ApnnwrYbD7QcwIp

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js


1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in [.env.local](.env.local) to your Gemini API key
3. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`

## Mobile testing & PWA

- Build for production: `npm run build`
- Preview the production build locally: `npm run preview`
- To test PWA/install behavior, open the preview URL on a mobile device or in Chrome's device emulator and check install prompt / service worker caching.
- For best mobile experience, check that the viewport meta tag and safe-area paddings are respected and that touch targets are comfortably sized.
